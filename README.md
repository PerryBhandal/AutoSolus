AutoSolus
=========

AutoSolus is a tool to automatically monitor and join full classes through Queen's University's SOLUS system

Usage Instructions
=========
1) Open autoSolus.py and enter your Queen's netID and password (in USERNAME and PASSWORD, respectively).

2) Log into SOLUS and add the courses you wish to join that are currently full to your shopping cart.

3) To run AutoSolus you can either execute autoSolus.py, which will do a single ejoin attempt. Alternately, you can run the ruby script runner.rb, which will repeatedly attempt to join all courses in your cart. See the top of runner.rb for settings to specify the delay between attempts.
